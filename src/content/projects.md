      myWelly was by far my most successful project during my time at
      Wellington. I like to think that it was one of the best learning
      experiences I've ever had in terms of creating, supporting and
      distributing large scale projects for many users to use. Developed by a
      student-run business inside college, this app was one of highlights of my
      time at Wellington

      Foundry21 (Media & Productions) is a professional freelance production
      company with the aim of creating sleek and modern videos for whatever you
      require. I was approached by my friend Finn Ducker, who runs the company.
      This website is a static website written in GatsbyJS and powered by
      NetlifyCMS with a YouTube widget to present his portfolio in a sleek
      minimalistic fashion. This website was my first client website, and I can
      say that it was a success on all parts. Check it out here:
