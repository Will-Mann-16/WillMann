      myWelly was by far my most successful project during my time at
      Wellington. I like to think that it was one of the best learning
      experiences I've ever had in terms of creating, supporting and
      distributing large scale projects for many users to use. Developed by a
      student-run business inside college, this app was one of highlights of my
      time at Wellington
    languages:
      - ReactJS
      - NodeJS
      - MongoDB
      - AWS
